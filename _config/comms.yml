    After you _"ask to join"_ this community go to
    "ingress.com/intel":https://www.ingress.com/intel?ll=-37.813702,144.957132&z=14 and centre your map
    over Melbourne then in faction chat broadcast your _Google+
    profile initials_ to prove your Resistance credentials i.e.
    *"request to join g+ group, my initials are XY @doobmie @GenElectrik @iwilldestroy @clareabelle @Stationary @PhiAU"*
    or if you already know a Resistance member ask them to vouch
    for you in the group and a mod will invite you.
     
    Adding the
    *@doobmie @GenElectrik @iwilldestroy @clareabelle @Stationary @PhiAU*
    part makes it easier for our mods to see your request and add
    you to the community quicker.
