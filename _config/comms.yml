    After you _"ask to join"_ this community go to
    "ingress.com/intel":http://ingress.com/intel and centre your map
    over Melbourne then in faction chat broadcast your _Google+
    profile initials_ to prove your Resistance credentials i.e.
    *"request to join g+ group, my initials are XY @nicktorious
    @maiestia @puddle @simonoid"* or if you already know a Resistance
    member ask them to vouch for you in the group and a mod will
    invite you.
     
    Adding the *@nicktorious @maiestia @puddle @simonoid* part makes
    it easier for our mods to see your request and add you to the
    community quicker.
