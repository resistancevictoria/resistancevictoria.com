## README.md

This site is built using [{:awestruct}](http://awestruct.org) and the [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) framework.

Pages are written using a mixture of [haml](http://haml.info/), [textile](http://textile.sitemonks.com/) and [md](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (depending on layout requirements).

Everything is version controlled and stored in a [git](http://git-scm.com/) repo.

It is developed on a Debian VPS with staging and production hosted on [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/) [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

**&lt;/geekout&gt;**
