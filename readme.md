> This site is built using [{:awestruct}](http://awestruct.org) and the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework. Pages are written using a mixture of [haml](http://haml.info/), [textile](http://textile.sitemonks.com/) and [md](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (depending on layout requirements). Everything is version controlled and stored in a [GitHub <i class="fa fa-github"></i> repository](https://github.com/resistancevictoria/resistancevictoria.com). Development is done on a Debian VPS with staging and production hosted on [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/) [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). Static is the new dynamic.
