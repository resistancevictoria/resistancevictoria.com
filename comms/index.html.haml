      Once you have activated your scanner and joined the Resistance you should _"ask to join"_ any local communities below and reach out to your nearby fellow Resistance agents via faction comms. They can help you with portal locations, supplies, tactics, levelling up and the best places for food and drinks when the Ingressing gets too much (or you're waiting for a portal to cool down).

      After you _"ask to join"_ this community go to "ingress.com/intel":http://ingress.com/intel and centre your map over Melbourne then in faction chat broadcast your Google+ initials to prove your Resistance credentials e.g. _"request to join g+ group, my initials are JB @nicktorious @maiestia @puddle @simonoid"_ or if you already know a Resistance member ask them to vouch for you in the group and a mod will invite you.

      The _@nicktorious @maiestia @puddle @simonoid_ part makes it easier for our mods to see your request and add you to the community quicker.

      The Enlightened are people too (albeit misguided foolish people). General chat for all Ingress players in Victoria can be had in this community. This is where you can organise meet ups, cease fires, etc.

      This community is for verified Ingress players to post, but it is public for anyone to read. To verify first _"ask to join"_ the community and then go to the Intel site, centre your map over Melbourne and broadcast on *public comms*: _"request to join all faction group, my initials are JB"_ (using your own initials of course).

          We are aware that Enlightened have spy agents in our communities and our secure faction comms. Keep this in mind when you are planning large impact operations, only communicate with agents you know and trust via more direct and secure communications methods such as _Google+ Hangouts_. Feeding misinformation to spies can sometimes be handy.
